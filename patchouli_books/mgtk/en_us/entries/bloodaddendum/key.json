Leaving is as easy as doing the same thing again, or right clicking on the core, which stabilizes the entire area and prevents it from collapsing. The space itself is rather small, you only have a 14x2x14 block space. Thankfully, the core can also help with that. By right clicking it while holding a Raw Soul, the amount of vertical space you have will be increased by 1 block."

The walls are as hard as Bedrock, and even if you were to get outside, it would likely be extremely unpleasant. It is unknown what would happen, but it is theorized you would remember everything that has ever happened to your soul, including any past lives, all at once. Something like this would likely overwhelm your mortal self, rendering you instantly braindead."
