# MagiTekkit

This repository contains most of the files necessary to run unreleased versions of MagiTekkit. Uploaded mainly to assist in development. Not recommended for actual use.

It also serves as a bug tracker.

Weird pointless file changes (whitespace updates, config file date updates, etc) are the fault of the game. Not much I can do about it, so sorry for the clutter.
